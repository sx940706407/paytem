  - `plugins`: contains any sort of add-on behavior and rules, that may or not may be available at all times.
  - `rules`: contains validation rules that are available to the validator instances.
  - `utils`: contains small utility functions.
- `dist` contains the unminified and the minified build of the repository.
- `docs` contains the src and built files for the documentation, we use [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) to generate the docs content.
- `locale` contains the localized messages files.
- `tests` contains the test files for the project, it uses [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) for testing. it contains a similar folder structure as the `src` folder.

### Contributing To The Docs

If you want to contribute to the docs you can find it in the `docs` folder.

Our docs require `./dist/vee-validate.esm` as dependency to run successfully in your local machine. You can generate this dependency by executing the following command from the root of the repository:

```
npm run build:esm
```

And then you can run vuepress by typing:

```
npm run docs:dev
```

### Pull Requests

- Respect the ESlint rules, but we are open to any suggestions or alterations.
- You don't have to build the library with each pull request, but you will if you plan to test it manually. No need to submit it in the PR to avoid unnecessary conflicts.
- PRs should have titles that are clear as possible.
- Make sure that your PR is up to date with the branch you are targeting, use git rebase for this.
- Unfinished/In-Progress PRs should have `[WIP]` prefix to them, and preferably a checklist for ongoing todos.
- Make sure to mention which issues are being fixed by the PR so they can be closed properly.

### Source Code

Currently we are using ES2015 (ES6) for the source code, using buble and rollup to convert and bundle it to ES5, the available builds are: non-minified and minified and es6 build.

Also we are using ESlint for code style, with the standard config with few modifications, please respect them as much as you can.

### Testing

Each test file represents a unit test to the corresponding file in the src folder.

To run the tests:

`npm test`

### Building

Use `npm run build` to build the project both minified and unminified versions.
