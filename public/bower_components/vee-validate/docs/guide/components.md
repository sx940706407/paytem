# Validation Components

::: tip
 This feature is available as of `v2.1.0`.
:::

VeeValidate ships with components for more advanced use cases. These components offer a different approach for validation using the [scoped slots feature](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-slots.html#Scoped-Slots) to pass down validation state and results.

Currently there are two components:

- [ValidationProvider](./components/validation-provider.md)
- [ValidationObserver](./components/validation-observer.md)
