# Introduction

VeeValidate is a validation library for Vue.js. It has plenty of validation rules out of the box and support for custom ones as well. It is template based so it is similar and familiar with the HTML5 validation API. You can validate HTML5 inputs as well as custom Vue components.

It is also built with localization in mind, in fact we have about 44 languages supported and maintained by the wonderful community members.

## Features

- Template based validation.
- [Many validation rules are provided out of the box](./rules.md).
